## Hi, I'm Kyle 👋

I'm based in the South West of the UK, and have a background in retail management and IT. I'm looking to reskill and switch into the data industry.

- I’m currently specialising in Data Engineering at AiCore, and looking to move into the Data Engineering industry after completion of my studies. 
- I’m currently learning Python, Javascript, SQL, AWS, Databricks, and some Japanese among other things!
